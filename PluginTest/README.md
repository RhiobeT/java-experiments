This is a WIP eclipse plugin (at an extremely early stage)

What it does at the moment:
* The user can right click on a .java file in the Project Explorer and start the 'PluginTest' command
* The class will be visited and its methods will be printed to the standard output
* A copy of the class, with an added import statement, will be saved in a new folder called "generated"
